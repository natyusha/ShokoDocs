# Series Without Files

The Series Without Files utility is designed to help you identify and remove orphaned series that have not been
properly deleted, as well as series that may have been created accidentally for a variety of reasons. For the majority
of users, series that do not contain any files are of no value, and it is recommended to delete these empty series
upon discovery.

To remove an empty series, click on it and then select the **Delete** button in the utility's navigation bar. Please be
aware that currently, images downloaded for the empty series will not be deleted.
