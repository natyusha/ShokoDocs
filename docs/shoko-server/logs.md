# Logs

Logs provide a detailed, step-by-step history of every action that Shoko has performed related to your collection.
Within these logs, you can track the process of importing a file, see the detailed results of executing a specific
action, and find error statements for any issues Shoko encountered while managing your collection.

Currently, the logging system is limited to outputting your current log file. Future enhancements, such as type
highlighting, search functionality, and improved readability, are planned. For now, use the logs as a reference or
if a Shoko team member on Discord instructs you to do so.
