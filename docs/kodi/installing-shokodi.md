# Installing Shokodi

Shokodi (a fusion of "Shoko" and "Kodi") is a lightweight alternative plugin designed for speed and minimal features,
with the intention of leaving collection management and configuration tasks to Shoko. It is important to note that
Shokodi is not intended to be a direct replacement for [Nakamori](https://shokunin.monogatari.pl/projects/nakamori/),
but rather an alternative for users looking for a minimal solution instead of a full-featured solution.

## Which Plugin Should I Use?

**Shokodi** is your choice for a fast, feature-restricted plugin that seamlessly functions across multiple versions
with minimal upkeep. Its features encompass scrobbling, resume functionality, tracking watched states, and
delivering speedy playback.

On the other hand, opt for **Nakamori** if you wish to not only watch your collection within Kodi but also have the
ability to comprehensively manage it without ever having to leave the options menu.

Both plugins operate as intended, each adhering to distinct philosophies regarding the scope of a plugin's
functionality.

## Repository Installation

By installing and using the repository, you'll have the ability to update the plugin from within Kodi itself.
Since this is not an official Kodi plugin, follow these steps to add the Shokodi repository:

![Kodi - System Settings](/images/shokodi/kodi-system-settings.jpg)

First, download the .zip file containing the Shokodi repository from insert link. Then, launch Kodi and navigate to
the **Systems Section** located in the **Settings Menu**. Once there, select **Add-Ons**.

To install a custom repository, you'll need to enable the **Unknown Sources** option. Follow the prompts and
once you've done that, return to the **Systems Section**, and this time, select the **Add-On** section.

Now, select **Install From Zip File** and choose the newly downloaded Shokodi zip file. Once this process is complete,
the Shokodi repository will be available in the **Install From Repository List** on the previous section.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Shokodi.
