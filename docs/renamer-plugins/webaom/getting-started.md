# Getting Started

The WebAOM renamer is the default renamer that ships with Shoko. It re-implements the scripting language used in
[WebAOM](https://wiki.anidb.net/WebAOM). There may be discrepancies between the results of this renamer and
the original.

Limitations:

- This renamer is only fitting for basic renaming logic.
- File moving is not customizable beyond the group-aware sorting option.
